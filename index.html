    <h1 id="firsth1">FOOD DESERTS</h1>
    <p id="bio">Food deserts are communities with limited access to healthy and affordable food. Supermarkets and fresh produce may be miles out of reach. <a href="https://www.gih.org/files/AudioConf/Freshworks-Food-Access-Report_WEB2_FINAL.pdf" target="_blank">In California alone</a>, over one million citizens live with food insecurity.
    <br>
    <br>
    According to the <a href="https://www.ers.usda.gov/webdocs/publications/45014/30940_err140.pdf" target="_blank">USDA</a>, areas that have high rates of poverty, large population of people of color, and lower urban density are more likely to be food deserts. Members of these communities may have poor nutrition and diet. They may also develop chronic illnesses such as heart disease, obesity, and diabetes. 
    <br>
    <br>
      Causing increased mortality rates and lower life expectancies, <a href="https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/food-deserts" target="_blank">food deserts</a> are a result of systemic racism, wealth gaps, and policies set in place.</p>

<!-- THE ROOT PROBLEM FOR FOOD DESERTS -->
  <div id="box3">
      <br>
    <h1 id="firsth1">THE INTERSECTIONALITY</h1>
    <p id="moreInfo">Politics, economics, and social factors all play a part in food insecurity. For example, the impact of <em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redlining">redlining</a></em>, a discriminatory and illegal practice where banks refused to offer minorities mortgages to buy homes. The effect still stands today years after its ban. People of color were forced to live in designated neighbourhoods that aren't crossed off. These acist housing policies made it nearly impossible for black people to pass down property. Seen even today, this continues on as the <em><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/outlook/2019/06/19/why-racial-wealth-gap-persists-more-than-years-after-emancipation/" target="_blank">generational racial wealth gap</a></em>.
<br>
<br>
Racism had also demonstrated job and educational discrimination. Marginalized groups had a harder time finding jobs, especially high-earning ones; rent was high, and minorities were forced to move into cities; and there were inadequate and disinvested schools in the area.
<br>
<br>
On top of that, there is a harmful stigma where people of color are considered unreliable, criminals, and bad for business because they are seen as "poor." Supermarkets and other businesses have used these excuses to not set up shop in low-income neighbourhoods with a high population of minorities. They may even increase their prices to gear towards richer neighborhoods and play on the notion of "food scarcity." This lack of access to healthy and organic food is called, "<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2018/may/15/food-apartheid-food-deserts-racism-inequality-america-karen-washington-interview" target="_blank">Food Apartheid</a>."</p>
